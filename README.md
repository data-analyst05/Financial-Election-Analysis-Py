# Financial Analysis and Election Results with Python
In this project, I analyze financial and election data using Python scripts. The scripts read data from CSV files, perform calculations, and provide insightful results. Both scripts output the analysis to the terminal and also export the results to text files.

# Financial Analysis
The financial_analysis.py script analyzes financial records from the "budget_data.csv" dataset. It calculates the following values:

Total number of months\
Net total amount of "Profit/Losses"\
Changes in "Profit/Losses" and the average of those changes\
Greatest increase in profits (date and amount)\
Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)\
The results are printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

# Election Results
The election_results.py script analyzes election data from the "election_data.csv" dataset. It calculates the following values:

Total number of votes cast\
Complete list of candidates who received votes\
Percentage of votes each candidate won\
Total number of votes each candidate won\
Winner of the election based on popular vote\
The results are printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

Usage
Ensure you have the required CSV files: "budget_data.csv" for financial analysis and "election_data.csv" for election results.

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts.\
Run each script using the Python interpreter:\
*`python financial_analysis.py`*\
*`python election_results.py`*
